Setting Up the Besu network:
	Requirements:
		1. 4 CPU cores
		2. 8 Gb memory
		3. Active internet connection
		4. Docker and minikube/kubernets with kubectl preinstalled
	To run the given deployment: ./deploy.sh
	To remove the deployments: ./remove.sh
	**In the above case the deployments will run with the private key in the ibft-setup**(Refer besu docs for creating own keys and changing genesis configuration)
	**if using minikube expose the besu network to the local network using: kubectl port-forward -n besu pod/validator1-0 8545:8545**
	for monitoring: minikube: minikube dashboard --url
			besu-network(minikube): get minikube ip using- minikube ip
						in browser: minikube ip/30030
			block generation: docker run --rm -p 8081:80 -e APP_NODE_URL=http://localhost:8545 alethio/ethereum-lite-explorer
			**APP_NODE_URL is the validator 1 url that is exposed locally**
	Expose the besu network by exposing minikube port to the internet or portforwarding(ngrok was used in the project).
	
Deploying Smart Contracts(using remix):
	Requirements: 
		1. Metamask
		2. Network ip
		3. Network id
	Open metamask create wallet:
		go to the network section:
			add custom network:
				give network url and chainid and click ok.
		use the 4 validator keys and private keys in the genesis file to have the 7 accounts of which 3 are prefunded.
	**private keys are the ones that are outside the pubkey enclosure/the funds should be moved before sharing genesis for creating subsequent nodes for security**
	deploying contracts:
		**contracts can be deployed only by validator accounts**
		move all the smart contracts to remix.(besu uses solidity 7.6)
		compile smart contracts and store the abi files(to be used in frontend)
		go to deployment section:
			Connect remix with metamask
			configure a validator account in metamask and deploy the contracts one by one in the folloeing order:
				1. usermanager
				2. bookmanager(requires usermanager contract address)
				3. borrowmanager(requires bookmanager and usermanager contract address)
	Share the deployed contract address as well as the abi files with the frontend.

Frontend:
	steps:

1. Update the API URL and Contract Address

Navigate to the file: client/src/services/api.js (or similar).

Open the file and update the API base URL

Also, update the smart contract address if applicable, replacing the old one with the new deployed contract address.



2. Connect MetaMask Wallet

Open your browser and ensure the MetaMask extension is installed.

Add a custom network in MetaMask using the updated blockchain node URL (e.g., http://localhost:8545 or your testnet/mainnet RPC URL).

Switch to this network in MetaMask.

In your app, trigger the wallet connection (e.g., via a “Connect Wallet” button) to link MetaMask.



3. Start the React Client

Open a terminal and navigate to the client directory.

Run the following command:

npm run start

This will start the React development server, and your DApp will open in the browser.
